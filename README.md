# Football-Stats

### Hello, My name is Dhairy Raval and this is a simple project that I made using react and football-data.org's free API.

The main goal of this project is to help users get stats from any major football leagues, competitions in a quick and simple manner. 

---

### [Live Project](https://dhairyraval.github.io/football-stats/#/)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
<br><br>

Over the course of development I was able to learn and practice with many concepts and frameworks like: 
 - Using Axios
 - Resolving CORS issues when using 3rd party resources like APIs
 - Using material-ui components
 - Hosting react-apps with github pages



## Getting Started

To start the project locally, run the following commands in the project directory:

 - `npm i` or `npm install` to install the all the dependencies for the app
 
 - `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Please let me know if you have any feedback, suggestions \
Thanks üòÅ
